# Learning-AI
I have been learning an introduction to AI in Python Colab by making simple structures from scratch without using AI-Libraries.

**Linear Regression**:
    An introductory concept in understanding AI. The program iteratively finds the point with the lowest average distance to every point. (logically, one can take the average of the coordinates, but that was ignored for the purpose of the exercise.)

**K-Means Clustering**:
    A form of data organization, the algorithm iteratively finds the best way to categorize data in groups or clusters and estimated the optimal amount of clusters.

**Logistic Regression**:
    The last step before real neural networks. Logistic regression serves to predict a binary separation of data. This served as an introduction for me to Log-Loss Error and Activation Functions.

**Feed-Forward Network**:
    A simple dense feed-forward neural network using NumPy matrix math to predict a line (y = 2x+7), given data points close to 2x+7 with randomized error. 

**Pokemon Network**:
    Now that I understood neural networks and had made one myself, I began using a library to simplify the process with the goal of using Pokemon stats to predict if a given Pokemon is legendary or not.
